# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| x.0.2  (beta edition) | :white_check_mark: (submit here) |
| x.0.1 (beta edition)  | :x: (please submit via Beta Tester channels) |
| x.0.0 (dev edition)   | :x: (please submit via Dev channels) |


## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vunerability, please go to this repo's **Security** tab and use Private Vunerability Reporting (PVR).
All vunerabilities are to be treated as confidential (as if they were an extremely critical issue).


## Compensation & Reward

As not to encourage malicious behaviour, we do not offer monetary rewards for vunerabilities reported at this time. If you are interested in a paid position, check out our [Careers Portal](https://otterance.io/careers)!


## Safe Harbour Policy

You may test for security vunerabilities in an isolated environment (ie. not impacting production servers). Your testing must not damage the service or experience for other users. Any damage to software, accidental or intentional, production or testing, will be considered unauthorised access.

**YOU MUST DISCLOSE VUNERABILITIES (SUSPECTED OR KNOWN) WITHIN 24 HOURS OF DISCOVERY. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL BE CONSIDERED A BREACH OF THIS POLICY.**

To the fullest extent permitted by international law, we will not take legal action against ethical hacking permitted by this policy.


## "What Should I Report?"
You may use PVR to report any vunerabilities that may cause disruption to Otterance services (eg. exposed secret API keys, leaked source code, etc). Plesae include a brief description of the severity in your report.
When reporting leaked code, please cite where you found this code and include a screenshot.


## Isolated Testing For PenTesting Teams
If you wish for a seperate instance of Otterance on an isolated VPS, please contact the Chief Technology Officer via [otterance.io/contact](https://otterance.io/contact). Please note that we are not able to fulfill all requests, and your team may need to meet certain requirements before gaining access. We are unable to provide root user or source code access.
